 #QUESTION...The code provided outlines the implementation of a Bakery Management System in Python. The system is built using object-oriented programming principles 
            and includes the following features:

1) Adding Items to the Bakery: The system allows adding bakery items with details like name, price, and stock quantity.

2) Viewing Available Items: The view_items() method displays all the available items in the bakery, showing their name, price, and stock.

3) Placing an Order: The place_order() method allows customers to place orders by selecting items from the menu, specifying quantities, and calculating the total 
   order price. It also checks if enough stock is available before adding items to the order.

4) Viewing Orders: The view_order() method retrieves and displays details for a specific order using an order ID.

5) Exporting Order Data to Excel: The export_to_excel() method exports all order data to an Excel file, allowing for record-keeping or reporting.
